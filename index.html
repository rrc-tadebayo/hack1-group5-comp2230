    </h1> Napoleonic Wars
    <section>
        The Napoleonic Wars (1803 to 1815) were a series of global 
        conflicts in which various European coalitions fought against 
        France, first as the French Republic and later under Napoleon Empire. 
        Rooted in the French Revolution and the earlier Revolutionary Wars, 
        they led to French dominance over much of Continental Europe.
        The wars are typically divided into seven conflicts: five named 
        after the coalitions (Third to Seventh) and two for specific campaignsâ€”the 
        Peninsular War and the French invasion of Russia.

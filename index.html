        <h1>Napoleon: Genius Leader or Power-Hungry Dictator?</h1>
        <p>Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821) was a French military leader and statesman
            who rose to prominence during the French Revolution. Born on the island of Corsica,
            he became one of history’s most famous generals, known for his brilliant battlefield tactics and ambitious political career.
            However, his ambitions ultimately led to overreach. His failed invasion of Russia in 1812 and the defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 ended his reign.
            He was exiled to the island of Saint Helena, where he died in 1821.
            He remains a controversial figure—celebrated as a genius leader and reformer, but also criticized as a power-hungry conqueror.</p>

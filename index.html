        <h1>Napoleon: Genius Leader or Power-Hungry Dictator?</h1>
        <p>Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821) was a French military leader and statesman
            who rose to prominence during the French Revolution. Born on the island of Corsica,
            he became one of history’s most famous generals, known for his brilliant battlefield tactics and ambitious political career.
            However, his ambitions ultimately led to overreach. His failed invasion of Russia in 1812 and the defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 ended his reign.
            He was exiled to the island of Saint Helena, where he died in 1821.
            He remains a controversial figure—celebrated as a genius leader and reformer, but also criticized as a power-hungry conqueror.</p>

        <h1>Early life</h1>
        <p>Napoleon's family was of Italian origin. His paternal ancestors, the Buonapartes, descended from a minor Tuscan noble family who emigrated to Corsica in the 16th century. His maternal ancestors, the Ramolinos, descended from a noble family from Lombardy.[12] Napoleon's parents, Carlo Maria Buonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino, lived in the Maison Bonaparte home in Ajaccio, where Napoleon was born on 15 August 1769. He had an elder brother, Joseph, and six younger siblings: Lucien, Elisa, Louis, Pauline, Caroline, and Jérôme. Five more siblings were stillborn or did not survive infancy. Napoleon was baptized as a Catholic under the name Napoleone di Buonaparte. In his youth, his name was also spelled as Nabulione, Nabulio, Napolionne, and Napulione</p>

         <h1>Napoleonic Wars</h1>
         <p>
            The Napoleonic Wars (1803 to 1815) were a series of global 
            conflicts in which various European coalitions fought against 
            France, first as the French Republic and later under Napoleon Empire. 
            Rooted in the French Revolution and the earlier Revolutionary Wars, 
            they led to French dominance over much of Continental Europe.
            The wars are typically divided into seven conflicts: five named 
            after the coalitions (Third to Seventh) and two for specific campaigns the 
            Peninsular War and the French invasion of Russia.
